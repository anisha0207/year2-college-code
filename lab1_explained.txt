main
This program does not explicitly pass arguments like argc and argv, but it
instead passed int i, num, j. User is prompted to entering a number using
scanf("%d", &num); which assigns input value to num.
Variables i adn j are decalred but not intitialized. 

Program gave very large or incorrect output for factorial due to unitialized 
variable j. There is also incorrect loop condition along with undefined 
behavior where j is never initialized when multiplying with i. Within the
loop, there should be i <= num along with j being initialized to 1 to make 
this program run smoothly.
