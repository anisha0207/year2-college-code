# CSE109 Systems Software - Spring 2025

# Recitation 7

Due: 4/25/25 EOD

## Objective

To compile the a client and server socket tuturial programs and have them communicate.

## Assignment

In this recitation, you will explore basic TCP/IP socket programming using C. You will compile two programs: a server that listens for connections and responds with a message, and a client that connects to the server and receives the message. This exercise will help reinforce your understanding of network communication, system calls, and inter-process data transfer.

We will be following the tutorial here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_sockets/index.htm

### Part 1 - Server

The server is a program that will obtain a socket resource, and use it to listen to incoming connections from a client machine. The first iteration of the server is a *blocking* server, meaning that it will block incoming connections while servicing the current connection. If the server is servicing a request and a client connects, the connection will be refused.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <netdb.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

#include <string.h>

int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
   int sockfd, newsockfd, portno, clilen;
   char buffer[256];
   struct sockaddr_in serv_addr, cli_addr;
   int  n;
   
   /* First call to socket() function */
   sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   
   if (sockfd < 0) {
      perror("ERROR opening socket");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   /* Initialize socket structure */
   bzero((char *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
   portno = 5001;
   
   serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
   serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);
   
   /* Now bind the host address using bind() call.*/
   if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
      perror("ERROR on binding");
      exit(1);
   }
      
   /* Now start listening for the clients, here process will
      * go in sleep mode and will wait for the incoming connection
   */
   
   listen(sockfd,5);
   clilen = sizeof(cli_addr);
   
   /* Accept actual connection from the client */
   newsockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&cli_addr, &clilen);
	
   if (newsockfd < 0) {
      perror("ERROR on accept");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   /* If connection is established then start communicating */
   bzero(buffer,256);
   n = read( newsockfd,buffer,255 );
   
   if (n < 0) {
      perror("ERROR reading from socket");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   printf("Here is the message: %s\n",buffer);
   
   /* Write a response to the client */
   n = write(newsockfd,"I got your message",18);
   
   if (n < 0) {
      perror("ERROR writing to socket");
      exit(1);
   }
      
   return 0;
}
```

Note the port number, 5001. If this one is in use, try another. The port doesn't matter as long as the client knows which one to use.

## Part 2 - Client

The client is a program will obtain a socket resource and use that to connect to the supplied IP address and port number. It attempts to establish a connection, and if successful, it will then send a message.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <netdb.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   int sockfd, portno, n;
   struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;
   struct hostent *server;
   
   char buffer[256];
   
   if (argc < 3) {
      fprintf(stderr,"usage %s hostname port\n", argv[0]);
      exit(0);
   }
	
   portno = atoi(argv[2]);
   
   /* Create a socket point */
   sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   
   if (sockfd < 0) {
      perror("ERROR opening socket");
      exit(1);
   }
	
   server = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
   
   if (server == NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr,"ERROR, no such host\n");
      exit(0);
   }
   
   bzero((char *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
   serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   bcopy((char *)server->h_addr, (char *)&serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr, server->h_length);
   serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);
   
   /* Now connect to the server */
   if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
      perror("ERROR connecting");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   /* Now ask for a message from the user, this message
      * will be read by server
   */
	
   printf("Please enter the message: ");
   bzero(buffer,256);
   fgets(buffer,255,stdin);
   
   /* Send message to the server */
   n = write(sockfd, buffer, strlen(buffer));
   
   if (n < 0) {
      perror("ERROR writing to socket");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   /* Now read server response */
   bzero(buffer,256);
   n = read(sockfd, buffer, 255);
   
   if (n < 0) {
      perror("ERROR reading from socket");
      exit(1);
   }
	
   printf("%s\n",buffer);
   return 0;
}
```

The program takes a address and port as input arguments. It connects and prompts the user for a message. Input the message into the terminal and press enter. This will send the message to the server, which should print out:

```
Here is the message: <message contents here>
```

Then it will send to the client:

```
I got your message.
```

The client will print this out to its terminal.


## Part 3 Compile and Run

1. Use gcc to compile both programs:

```
gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c
```

2. Run the Server

Start the server in one terminal window:

```
./server
```

3. Run the Client

In a second terminal, run the client:

```
./client localhost 5001
```

If the connection fails, you might need to use `127.0.0.1` in place of localhost. Also you might need a different port. If you use a different one though, you'll have to change it in the server code, as it's hardcoded into the source.


## Part 4 - Nonblocking server

We can write a nonblocking server using the `fork()` system call, which spawns a brand new process to service the connection, leaving the original process available to wait for more connections.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <netdb.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

#include <string.h>

void doprocessing (int sock);

int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
   int sockfd, newsockfd, portno, clilen;
   char buffer[256];
   struct sockaddr_in serv_addr, cli_addr;
   int n, pid;
   
   /* First call to socket() function */
   sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   
   if (sockfd < 0) {
      perror("ERROR opening socket");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   /* Initialize socket structure */
   bzero((char *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
   portno = 5001;
   
   serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
   serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);
   
   /* Now bind the host address using bind() call.*/
   if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
      perror("ERROR on binding");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   /* Now start listening for the clients, here
      * process will go in sleep mode and will wait
      * for the incoming connection
   */
   
   listen(sockfd,5);
   clilen = sizeof(cli_addr);
   
   while (1) {
      newsockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &cli_addr, &clilen);
		
      if (newsockfd < 0) {
         perror("ERROR on accept");
         exit(1);
      }
      
      /* Create child process */
      pid = fork();
		
      if (pid < 0) {
         perror("ERROR on fork");
         exit(1);
      }
      
      if (pid == 0) {
         /* This is the client process */
         close(sockfd);
         doprocessing(newsockfd);
         exit(0);
      }
      else {
         close(newsockfd);
      }
		
   } /* end of while */
}
```

Here is an implementation of `doprocessing()`, which will be called in the forked process and will service the connection.

```
void doprocessing (int sock) {
   int n;
   char buffer[256];
   bzero(buffer,256);
   n = read(sock,buffer,255);
   
   if (n < 0) {
      perror("ERROR reading from socket");
      exit(1);
   }
   
   printf("Here is the message: %s\n",buffer);
   n = write(sock,"I got your message",18);
   
   if (n < 0) {
      perror("ERROR writing to socket");
      exit(1);
   }
	
}
```

1. Compile and run this new code and demonstrates it works the same as the other. 
2. Modify this code so that doprocessing does not return early. You can put it into an infinite loop where the client sends its reply and then waits at read for more information.
3. Start a third terminal, and connect to the server with another client. You should have three windows now:
    1. the server
    2. client 1, connected to the server
    3. client 2, connected to the server
